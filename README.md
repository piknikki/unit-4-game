Crystal Collector Game

There are four crystals here, each with a different "value".  You click on a crystal to boost your point value, but hahahaha, you don't know how much they're worth!  As you click, your score will be updated.  You win if/when your total score matches the random score generated by magic.  You lose if your score goes above the magically-generated score.  In other words, this is another version of Keyboard Whack-a-mole.

Your game will restart when you win or lose (and as such, magic will happen and a new score will be chosen for you to discover).  Of course, when the game is restarted, the crystals will be given a new value.  Ha.Ha.Ha.

The game will keep track of your wins and losses.
